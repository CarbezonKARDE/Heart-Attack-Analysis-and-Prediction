# Introduction
A heart attack, also known as myocardial infarction, occurs when part of the heart muscle does not receive enough blood. The main cause of heart attacks is coronary artery disease (CAD). This project focuses on analyzing data related to heart attacks and building predictive models to assist in early detection.

## Objectives
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Missing Value Analysis
- Categoric and Numeric Feature Analysis
- Standardization
- Modeling and Tuning Machine Learning Models

## Significance
- **Health Impact**: Early prediction of heart attacks can lead to timely interventions, reducing damage to heart muscles and improving patient outcomes.
- **Timely Treatment**: Predicting risks can ensure prompt treatment and minimize potential heart damage.
- **CAD Identification**: Identifying CAD risk can lead to targeted interventions to prevent heart attacks.

## Database
- **Name**: heart.csv
- **Columns**: 12
- **Rows**: 304

## Literature Review
Previous studies on the Heart Attack Prediction Dataset have explored various topics including:
- Efficiency using Linear Regression.
- Analysis through Box, Swarm, Cat, and Correlation Plot Analysis.
- Standardization of the dataset.

## Methodology

### Techniques
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier (XGBoost)

### Mathematical Equations
Mathematical formulas were used to model the prediction, but specifics are beyond this summary.

## Implementation

### Data Preparation
Data was prepared by reading `heart.csv`, followed by missing value analysis, unique value analysis, and feature analysis.

### Standardization
Data was standardized using `StandardScaler`, which adjusts the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
The KNN classifier was implemented and tested on the standardized data.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
The SVM classifier was implemented and tested, providing a strong baseline for comparison.

### Random Forest Classifier
The Random Forest classifier was used to enhance prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.

### Gradient Boosting Classifier
The Gradient Boosting classifier (XGBoost) was the most accurate, demonstrating its effectiveness for this prediction task.

## Conclusion and Future Scope

### Conclusion
The project successfully implemented several machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease, with XGBoost showing the highest accuracy. Data preprocessing and outlier detection significantly improved the model's robustness.

### Future Scope
